# 🌟 My Project Portfolio

Welcome to my project portfolio repository! This is a complete web-based application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Django**. The application consists of a navigation bar with four main sections, each showcasing different aspects of my work, including my internship experience, machine learning models, and image recognition projects.

## 🛠️ **Tech Stack:**
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
- **Backend:** Django (Python)
- **Database:** SQLite (or your preferred database)
- **Libraries & Tools:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy, Pandas

## 🔗 **Project Contents:**

### 1. 🏢 **About My Internship Company**
This section provides insights into my internship at **Karunadu Technologies**, including the company's mission, my learning journey, and the skills I gained during the experience.

### 2. 🚀 **Astral Classification using Spectral Characteristics using Naive Bayes Algorithm**
An ML project that classifies stellar objects (stars, galaxies, or quasars) using space observation data from the **Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)**.

- **Key Features:**
  - Right Ascension & Declination angles
  - Ultraviolet, Green, Red, Near Infrared, and Infrared filters
  - Redshift value, Plate ID, MJD, and Fiber ID
  - Class label (Star, Galaxy, or Quasar)

### 3. 📊 **Using Naive Bayes Algorithm**
Implemented the **Naive Bayes algorithm** for classification tasks. Despite its simplicity, this algorithm is effective for large datasets with categorical features.

- **Applications:**
  - Spam detection
  - Sentiment analysis
  - Document classification

### 4. 🥦 **Vegetable Classifier**
A machine learning project to classify vegetables into 15 distinct categories using image data i download from kaggle.

- **Vegetables Classified:** Bean, Bitter Gourd, Brinjal, Broccoli, Tomato, and more!
- **Use Cases:** Smart farming, automated grocery systems
